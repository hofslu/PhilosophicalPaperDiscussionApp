# Philosophical Paper Discussion App

## Project Overview
This project aims to create a web application that allows users to upload JSON files derived from PDF transcriptions of philosophical papers. The application will provide a user-friendly interface to interact with the texts, enabling paragraph-by-paragraph viewing, commenting, highlighting, and discussing connections between various philosophers and concepts.

## Features
- **Upload and Parse JSON Files:** Users can upload JSON files that contain the structured text of philosophical papers.
- **Text Interaction:** Users can read the papers paragraph by paragraph.
- **Annotation Tools:** Users can add comments, highlight text, and mark sections for later review.
- **Discussion Platform:** Integration with an LLM, such as ChatGPT, to facilitate discussions about the text and its philosophical implications.
- **Philosopher and Concept Connections:** Ability to discuss and visualize the connections between different philosophers and their ideas.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React.js for the user interface.
- **Backend:** Node.js and Express.js for server-side operations.
- **Database:** MongoDB or similar for storing user annotations and discussions.
- **LLM Integration:** OpenAI's GPT for enabling discussions.
